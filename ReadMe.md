## Introduction

Because some development needs to be tested on a mobile phone, I don't want to re-type the URL in the browser every time I retest, so I use zxing.net to tansfer the random URL generated by ngrok to QR code image for the phone to scan. In this way, similar development processes will not be so troublesome in the future. 

## Usage

```powershell
.\StartNgrok.ps1 [port]
```
